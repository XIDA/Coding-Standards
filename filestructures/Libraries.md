# Libraries #

## Location: ##
/libraries/{libraryname}/

## Definition ##
Most of the time a library is a like a [component](Components.md) but it's not done by XIDA.
For example you downloaded a project from GitHub, then add it to libraries.

Of course XIDA components can become libraries too, when they are used accross more than one project.

## Characteristics ##
same as [component](Components.md)
