Coding-Standards
================

This is the place where we store the coding standards that our code at XIDA complies with.
This helps us creating better code, with less headaches.

**We believe that standards can help in creating software that is better prepared for the constant changes that clients and their customers request.**

It also helps to prevent certain bugs / problems that were solved in earlier projects to resurface in the future (by adding new coding standards for typical bugs / problems).

**The standards listed here are always a work in progress** because the environment constantly changes (factors like programming languages, what clients expect, knowledge of our employees...).

However we will release a new standard from time to time.
This will be the standard every new project will use.
