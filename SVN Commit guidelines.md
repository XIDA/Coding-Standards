# SVN commit guidelines

Based on: [angular commit messages document  &raquo;](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QrDFcIiPjSLDn3EL15IJygNPiHORgU1_OOAqWjiDU5Y/edit?pli=1)

## Format of the commit message

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

>Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier to read on github as well as in various git tools.

#### Allowed `<type>`

 * **FEATURE** (feature)
 * **FIX** (bug fix)
 * **DOCS** (documentation)
 * **STYLE** (formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
 * **TEST** (when creating tests)
 * **CLEANUP** (remove unnecessary code, files)
 * **IMPROVE** (improvement, e.g. enhanced feature)
 * **TOOLS** (build, tools changes etc.)
 * **SVN** (ignore list changed, svn properties changed etc.)
 * **RELEASE**  (created a new .exe, .ipa, .apk etc.) There is no need to add the actual realeased file. But there should be a commit for every release so it is easier for old projects to track down what the last version was, that was send to the client


Release messages need to have the following format:
```
RELEASE (<scope>): <versionnumber>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

#### Allowed `<scope>`

Scope could be anything specifying place or element of the commit change(s).

#### Allowed `<subject>` text

 * use imperative, present tense: _change_ not _changed_ nor _changes_ or _changing_
 * do not capitalize first letter
 * do not append dot (.) at the end

> Subject line contains description of the change.

#### Allowed Message `<body>`

 * just as in <subject> use imperative, present tense: _change_ not _changed_ nor _changes_ or _changing_
 * include motivation for the change and contrast it with previous behavior
 * if commit is list use dash (-) to list items in a separate line

### Message Footer

#### Breaking changes

All breaking changes have to be mentioned in footer with the description of the change, justification and migration notes

```
BREAKING CHANGE: Id editing feature temporarily removed
As a work around, change the id in XML using replace all or friends
```
#### Referencing issues

Closed bugs / feature requests / issues should be listed on a separate line in the footer prefixed with "Closes" keyword like this:
 
    Closes #234

or in case of multiple issues:
 
    Closes #123, #245, #992
    
### Good commit message examples:

```
STYLE (notifications): change notifications

change warning notification colors:
- error notifications are now red
- warning and info notifications are now dark-yellow
```

or

```
FEATURE (editor): add emmet plug-in to editor

- add emmet plug-in to editor
- add emmet plug-in settings

Closes #351
```
